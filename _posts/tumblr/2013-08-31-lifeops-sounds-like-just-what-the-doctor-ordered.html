<p>LifeOps sounds like just what the Doctor ordered to me. I've started with some goals 6 months ago, and had varying degrees of success in sticking with them.</p>
<p>Sounding off some ideas, getting feedback and having some structure around it via regular meetings all sounds good to sustain the motivation.</p>
<p>Anchoring with DevOpsDC meetups and augmenting with hangout fits nicely for me as well. So count me in!</p>
