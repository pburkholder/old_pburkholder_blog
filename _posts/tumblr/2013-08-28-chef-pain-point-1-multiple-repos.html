<p>At $WORK we've been migrating from Puppet to Chef. I was in the minority in voting to stay with Puppet, since we were already 1/2 way through refactoring our initial Puppet implementation. </p>
<p>I have nothing against Chef as such, but there are some pain points that
others considering a Puppet to Chef migration should consider. I need to write
a full analysis of this migration, but with time short, I'll start by just sharing some pain points which I'll later pull into that magnum opus.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple repos</strong></p>
<p>Our Puppet code was in one repository. Our Chef code is in 24 repos so we
can use Berkshelf that's tied to versions and branches. When a Puppet module
failed due to some odd dependency, I could 'ack' through the repo to find the a clue for what I was missing. Try that with 15 repos. Ugh.</p>
